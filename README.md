## Project Overview  

Let's say **Ananya** is a Startup Founder and he needs help in writing his future posts.  
- Ananya can **upload her past LinkedIn posts** into the tool.  
- The tool will **analyze her writing style, tone, and common themes** like entrepreneurship, product launches, or leadership.  
- Ananya can then **choose a theme (e.g., "Leadership"), preferred length, and language**.  
- With one click on the **Generate** button, the tool will create a **fresh LinkedIn post** that feels authentic and aligned with her **personal voice and style**.

### Workflow:

   - Some past posts related to that specific topic/language/length are used for **few-shot learning** to guide the LLM about writing style.
